    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Carbonara is a beautiful, classic Italian pasta that's so creamy, you'd swear there's a good amount of cream in it. And indeed, there's plenty of recipes that cheat by adding in cream.</p>
    <p>But today, we're making spaghetti carbonara properly, the authentic, traditional way. No cream. Just egg, cheese and a splash of starchy pasta cooking water.</p>
    <p>15 minutes later, THIS is the sight that will be in front of you. And you'll make 60 million Italians beam with pride!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Guanciale</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Spaghetti</li>
        <li>Parmigiano Reggiano</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Batons:</strong> Cut the guanciale into thick batons. Biting through the golden brown crust into meaty bits of salty guanciale is part of the awesomeness that is carbonara!</li>
        <li><strong>Finely grate</strong> the parmigiana reggiano or pecorino. I use a microplane – one of can’t-live-without kitchenware items!</li>
        <li><strong>Sauce:</strong> Whisk together the egg, cheese and pepper in a large bowl. It needs to be a large bowl because the pasta will be stirred into the sauce in the bowl, off the stove, to avoid scrambling the eggs.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook pasta:</strong> Bring 4 litres (4 quarts) of water to the boil with 1 tablespoon of salt. Cook the pasta per packet directions. It should be firm, not soft, but fully cooked through.</li>
        <li><strong>Reserve pasta cooking water:</strong> Just before draining, scoop out one cup of pasta cooking water. Then drain the pasta in a colander.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook guanciale </strong>until golden while the pasta is cooking. You don’t need any oil, the guanciale will fry in its own fat.</li>
        <li><strong>Tumble pasta in guanciale: </strong>Tumble the hot pasta into the pan with the guanciale then toss so the pasta gets coated in the guanciale fat.</li>
        <li><strong>Transfer into sauce bowl: </strong>Tip the hot pasta into the bowl with the egg and use a rubber spatula to scrape out every drop of the guanciale fat into the bowl. That stuff is gold!</li>
        <li><strong>Add 1/2 cup pasta cooking water</strong> into the bowl.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix</strong> vigorously with the handle of a wooden spoon, spinning the pasta around, for around 30 seconds to 1 minute. Watch as the watery pale yellow liquid magically transforms into a creamy sauce. You know it’s ready when the sauce is no longer watery and pooled in the bottom of the bowl. Instead, it will be thickened, creamy, and clinging to the pasta!</li>
        <li><strong>Serve immediately in warm bowls</strong> Pasta waits for no one</li>
    </ol>
