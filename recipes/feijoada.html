    <p>In the recipe has our suggestion of combination, but in the end has proportion for you to choose. The very detailed step by step ensures the tasty and not heavy feijoada.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1.1kg salted pork rib (1 piece with 12 slats)</li>
        <li>800g of dried meat</li>
        <li>600g salted pork loin</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the beans in a sieve and wash well under running water. Transfer the grains to a large bowl and cover with 2.5 liters of water – if any float, discard. Cover with a plate and soak for 30 minutes – if the beans stay too long soaking can lose color and fade during the long cooking of the feijoada. Meanwhile, pre-cook the meats.</li>
        <li>Drain the water from the desalted meats and transfer to a large cauldron (or pan) with a capacity of 11 liters. Cover the meats with water and bring to high heat – about 4 liters are enough, the amount may vary according to the size of the pan, the important thing is that the meats should be completely immersed. Let cook for 10 minutes on high heat, counted after boiling – pre-cooking eliminates excess fat and salt from meats.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop the onions and garlic cloves. With a small knife, remove the skin from the dads. Drain the water from the beans.</li>
        <li>After 10 minutes, with a skimmer, transfer the pre-cooked meats to a large bowl and discard the cooking water, being careful not to burn.</li>
        <li>Return the cauldron to the high fire. When heating, drizzle with olive oil, add the onion and season with a pinch of salt. Roast for about 8 minutes until it starts to brown. Add the garlic, cumin, bay leaves and stir for 1 minute to perfume.</li>
        <li>Add the soaked beans to the stew and mix well. Add 6 liters of water and keep the pan on high heat. As soon as it starts to boil, add the pre-cooked dried meat and ribs, lower the heat and cook for 2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>After the first 2 hours of cooking, add the pre-cooked loin and the whole paios. Let it cook on low heat for another 3 hours, stirring occasionally gently so as not to break down the beans.</li>
        <li>With 30 minutes to the end of cooking, with tweezers, transfer the paios to the board and cut each in slices of 1 cm, diagonally. Turn the slices to the pan and cook until the 5 hours of total cooking, or until the meats are very soft and the feijoada broth begins to thicken. Serve with rice, braised cabbage, orange buds and roasted cassava flour.</li>
