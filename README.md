# odin-recipes

This project was done to get the feeling for the basics of HTML5. It was a project suggestion from The Odin Project in the Fundamentals path.

Main things learned:
- Create HTML files
- Write HTML files
- Add images to HTML files
- Link different files with each other
- Publish the page with the Github pages functionality

This project is purely for entertainment/educational purposes and it's NOT considered a portfolio project.
